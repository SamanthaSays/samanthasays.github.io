All mods are installed and managed through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex">Vortex</a>.

Daggerfall is played through <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/releases">Daggerfall Unity</a>.

Remember to not just blindly copy somebody else's mod list. Make sure each mod is one that you really want! Because of this, my installed dependencies are not listed.

Mods marked with a â™¥ heart are my top 10 favourites.
