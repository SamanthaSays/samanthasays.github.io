<h1>Hello there!</h1>
    
<p>My name is Samantha Says. I have no prior experience with making websites, so this is a constant learning experience for me!<br>Some parts will look under construction. Y'know, because they are.</p>
<p>In the future, this website will hold:
<ul>
    <li>A catalogue of my Elder Scrolls characters</li>
    <li>My modlists for various games</li>
    <li>Any creative writing I may end up doing (probably about The Elder Scrolls)</li>
    <li>A gallery of pretty screenshots I've taken!</li>
    <li>Some niche guides that I've made for various people</li>
    <li>Maybe even an Elder Scrolls idle game... if Bethesda won't make one, then I will</li>
</ul>
<p>Until then, thanks for visiting! <a href="https://twitter.com/samanthasaystv" title="Visit the Samantha Says Twitter page" target="_blank">You can also find me on Twitter</a>
