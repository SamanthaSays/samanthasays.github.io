This is a complete rundown on the channel points and mini-games available on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/samanthasays">Samantha Says'</a> Twitch channel.

<h2>Stamina</h2>

To turn the channel points and their redemptions into a fun RPG system, we've renamed the default channel points to Stamina. You can see how much Stamina you have at the bottom of the chat window.

Stamina is gained periodically by watching Samantha Says while she's live. Additionally, at certain intervals, you'll receive click-to-claim notifications at the bottom of the chat window. Clicking on these notifications will grant you some bonus Stamina.

Stamina is also earned through supporting the channel! There are large bonuses for following the channel, for watching consecutive streams, cheering with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bits">bits</a> (once per 30 days), and gifting <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/subs/samanthasays">subscriptions</a> (once per 30 days). Being a subscriber yourself will also grant you a multiplier on the amount of stamina you earn.

<h2>Redeems & Mini-Games</h2>

You can spend your Stamina to perform actions! To begin, simply click the Stamina icon at the bottom left of the chat window. Once done, a window will appear showing you the actions that you can perform by spending Stamina. Doing so will help you gain XP to level up. You can check your level by typing "!level" in the chat.

These actions are split into 3 categories: dailies, RPG, and mini-games.

Daily redemptions can be redeemed only once a day per person, and grant you a solid amount of XP for their low Stamina cost. Dailies have a lot of variety to them, so make sure to perform all 3 each stream!

RPG redemptions cost 100 Stamina, and allow you to perform various actions for XP. For now, it's just the reminder to stay hydrated, but new RPG redemptions will be added in the future. You may even be able to customise your character!

Mini-games are where you'll spend most of your Stamina. Some are cheap and reward a little XP, some are expensive and reward greater XP, but all of them are balanced so that there is no single best mini-game. You are likely to gain the same amount of XP by doing 10 Archery Practices as a single Pickpocket, so experiment and find your favourite! That being said, the cheaper options are much safer, while getting lucky with the more expensive options will grant you the biggest rewards.

        <td>[Personality] Barter</td>
        <td>If you find yourself with an excess of Stamina, you can barter a large amount for a fair amount of XP. Definitely the easiest way to spend mass amounts of Stamina, but with minimal profits, it's not intended to be something that you save up for.</td>

Levelling up from level 1 to level 2 requires 100 XP, and each level afterwards requires 25 XP more than the previous. For example, level 2 requires 100 total XP, level 3 requires total 225 XP, level 4 requires 375 total XP, etc. Remember to use the !level command to see how much XP you need to level up!
