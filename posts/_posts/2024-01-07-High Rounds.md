Here's the table with my highest rounds across the games. Only confirmed high rounds are listed, so unfortunately many of my early scores are lost to time.

I was very late to getting into modern (at the time) gaming as a kid. By the time I got my first console, which coincided with the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops, all of my friends had already been playing Call of Duty for a couple of years. It took me about a week of playing to discover that the maps had doors that could be opened, which finally helped me to reach round 10. My friends and I would spend our time after school playing Kino der Toten having a blast and messing around. When we reached round 30 for the first time, that was a huge milestone for us! I became hooked on zombies, to the point where my Xbox profile's bio was just a list of my high scores.

Later on, when I began streaming to Twitch, I was a much better player, able to take on high rounds and speedruns. Admittedly, speedruns were rather neglected by the community at the time, but hey I'll take a world record no matter what. Hopefully in the future I can find time to take on more high round attempts to properly flesh out this page!
