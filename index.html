<h3>Favourite quote:</h3>
<figure id="qotd">
    <blockquote>
        <p>Most computer gamers use the save game to maximise their playing ability. Any time something goes wrong, they return to a saved game and replay it until they get it right. The final history of their game looks like an endless streak of lucky breaks and perfect choices.</p>
        <p>Roleplaying is not about playing the perfect game. It is about building a character and creating a story... All adversity can be overcome, excepting only the character's actual death. In fact, you will never see some of the most interesting aspects of the game unless you play through your mistakes.</p>
        <p>If your character dies, gets locked in a dungeon, or some other truly catastrophic event takes place, by all means return to your last saved game and replay it. However, if your character is caught pickpocketing, if a quest goes wrong, or some other mundane mishap occurs, let it play out. You may be surprised by what happens next.</p>
