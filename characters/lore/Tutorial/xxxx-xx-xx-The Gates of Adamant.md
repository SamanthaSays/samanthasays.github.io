I awoke imprisoned in a strange ruin. An Elf seems willing to help me, but escaping this place may not be easy. Danger lurks around every corner, and I sense that some darkness arrived with me.
---

The sunlight in my eyes wakes me up almost as much as the cold wind whistling through the room. I find myself on a thin mattress of hay on an unfamiliar cold stone floor. Certainly not where I had fallen asleep...

Looking around my new surroundings, I see among the rubble on the floor a rotting wooden stool beside a campfire. The fire's smoke rises past the white, moss covered walls that that create my cell, up to the crumbling roof, before being pushed out of the two barred windows.

I climb to my feet. My gut doesn't tell me anything about how I got here. I'm not groggy, so certainly not poison. My hair lies flat on my head, and since my hair tends to stand up after anything beyond the most simple of spells are used, it seems no magic was involved. I continue to ponder as I step over a small collection of debris from the crumbling walls to gaze out of the metal bars that prevent me from climbing out of the window. Not that I could get that far if I did, I can't tell how high up I am but certainly high enough to see over the many foreign trees that block my view of the ground. Trying to see through the blue mist that blurs the distance, whatever building I'm in seems to be on the shoreline. Along which body of water, I cannot say, but judging by the unfamiliar flora, I'm not on Khenarthi's Roost any more.

"You're awake? Thank the stars."

---
I heard a voice, I should look around to find out who's speaking.
---

A woman's voice shakes me out of my train of thought. I spin around to see an Altmer, commonly known to Imperials as a High Elf, on the other side of my cell door. Like most Altmer, she is tall, with near flawless golden skin. She wears a heavily detailed blue ornate dress with golden metal trims, and a staff of undecernable style holstered on her back.

---
I spied an Elf on the other side of my cell door. I should speak with her.
---

"There you are, on your feet. I know magical translocation can really upset the stomach. Just take a moment and get your bearings, all right?"

Magical translocation... that can't be right, surely I'd have felt _something_. 

"Where am I?" I ask her.

"The Isle of Balfiera. Home of Clan Direnni," she explains. "I apologise for the cramped accomodations. We pride ourselves on courtesy, but circumstances here have taken a turn for the bizarre. I needed to make sure you weren't a danger to yourself or others."

"Can you let me out?"

She brings a hand to her chin and smirks. "You might not be so eager to escape once you hear what's going on. You arrived via a portal, along with a Daedric beast called Shyazzel. It seized control of our golems and unleashed them on the island. If I free you, will you help me stop Shyazzel?"

In my confusion about this whole situation, her smug tone struck me the wrong way. However, she did seem to be my easiest way of escape. "Yes. Set me free and I'll help."

"Wise choice. Just give me a moment." She bends down and unlocks the door to my cell with a silver key. "There. That should unlock the door. When you're ready, follow me."

---
NORIANWE unlocked the door. I should exit my cell and follow my liberator.
---

Exiting the cell, I step into a large, open room that looks like it could serve as a grand hall. Stone paths mark the perimeter, surrounding an indoor garden of surprising scale. It is mostly grass and bushes, but does feature a thick tree at either end, each reaching up to their own circular hole in the ceiling. A water feature sits in the very centre, a circular pool of water rippled by the wind surrounded by eight pillars of various degrees of decay. 

The room itself merely has four cells attached, all empty bar one, which houses a ghostly knight resting by a campfire. To my right is what was presumably a connecting hallway, now blocked by fallen stone and lit only by a bowl of magical blue fire. The Altmer woman has made her way to the end of the hall on my left. 

---
NORIANWE wants to speak with me before we proceed. I should talk to her and find out what she wants.
---

"There you are, free as a spring cricket. I hope you intend to keep your word. We'll need each other out there - of that I'm certain. The name's Norianwe, by the way. Of Clan Direnni. Pleased to make your acquaintance."

Direnni... where do I know that from? "Where are we headed?"

"We're bound for a place called the Keywright's Gallery. But first, I need to know you can defend yourself. Hurtling through the Aurbis and falling flat on your ear left you a bit sattered. Find a weapon and we'll work out the cobwebs. Fair?"

"Sure. But I have some questions."

"Of course. I can't promise total transparency, but I'll be as forthcoming as I can."

"You mentioned a Keywright's Gallery. What is that place?"

"The Keywright's Gallery is an ancient substructure of Balfiera Island, built long before my clan arrived."

"Why is it called the Keywright's Gallery?"

"On account of all the doors."

I pause, letting the silence show her what I thought of her joke. She continues, "The Gallery's full of ancient gates, each with some arcane connection to places in Tamriel and beyond. Once the gates came to life, rifts opened. You fell out of one of them. The Daedra, Shyazzel, emerged from another."

"How did you escape?"

"I cast an incantation of the Steed, snatched you up, and fled as fast as my feet would carry me. I heard the Daedra cursing, followed by some kind of explosion, but I didn't look back. I hope the Gallery is still standing."

"What are you doing here?"

"Nothing irresponsible if that's what you're asking," she says with a look of surprise. "I'm a member of Clan Direnni's intelligence guild, the Sinderill. More scholar than spy, I assure you. I was conducting some research in the Gallery, then... pop! You and that monster arrived."

"Why were you studying this place?"

"The Gallery's always been a place of special interest for the guild, but we never quite cracked how it worked. Despite the dangers, this is our greatest breakthrough to date! The guildmaster will be ecstatic, provided we get it under control."

"You said something about golems. What's going on here, exactly?"

"Would it frustrate you to hear that I have no idea? We Direnni are cautious by nature, so the Isle of Balfiera has many defences. Magical stone guardians protect many of our sacred sites, but somehow this Daedra found a way to turn them against us."

"Can you describe the Daedra, Shyazzel?"

She wrinkles her nose in disgust. "Ugh. Do I have to? If I recall my studies correctly, I'd say it's a Harvester - a huge serpentine creature that feeds on souls and magicka. If it finds a way to consume the energies of the Gallery, we will be in very serious trouble. Now, choose any weapon that strikes your fancy. I can't speak to their quality, but they seem sturdy enough to dispatch a beast or two."

Norianwe gestures to a collection of carved stone tables by the exit, each with a weapon sitting atop. I look over all of them. 

A sword and shield, a peerless example of Elven smithing, dulled by age and disuse. With the right technique, it can still deal out ample punishment. The ravages of time may have tarnished the shield, but it looks strong enough to deflect a golem's blows. 

A greataxe, while not as sharp as it once was, the Elven cleaver can still hew flesh, wood, and stone with brutal efficiency. 

A healing staff, soothing energy leaks from the cracks and whorls of it. It should mend most wounds well enough. 

An inferno staff, the fiery magic imbued into it has faded, but it is far from extinguished. 

A pair of daggers, centuries of neglect have robbed them of their luster, but in the right hands they can still draw blood. 

Finally, a bow, the aged wood creaks with every draw, but its aim remains true. 

I take the inferno staff.

Norianwe smiles. "Yes, I think that one suits you. If you change your mind, feel free to take any other weapon you want. Now, let's find a spot to practice."

She leads the way into the next room, and I stow my new staff and follow her through the door. The next room is smaller, but still rather open, and just as empty. It's a simple circle, with a slightly elevated platform in the middle displaying a suit of Elven armour. Another hole in the ceiling lets the sunlight through, but most of it is blocked by a bridge connecting the upper floors.

"This is as good a place as any," Norianwe says. "Now, prepare yourself while I conjure up a dance partner."

With a glow of blue magic, the suit of armour draws its greatsword and storms towards me. As fast as lightning, I draw my staff and shoot some balls of fire in quick succession. The animated armour steps back and bends over, but not in defence. It swings its greatsword underarm, and I'm barely able to hold out my staff in time to deflect the uppercut. While it regains its balance, I charge a dual fireball attack and blast the suit of armour to the ground. The empty helmet looks directly at me as it sweeps its legs along the ground, knocking me to the floor. The animated armour quickly stands above me and reaches its greatsword back for a heavy chop. I grasp my inferno staff with both hands and bash my aggressor, sending it staggering backwards. Another succession of fireballs is enough to send the pieces of armour across the floor, the blue glow fading from them.

"Well done!" Norianwe shouts to me. "With moves like that, the Daedra doesn't stand a chance! Yes, I'd say we're ready to set out."
YOU ALMOST KILLED ME?
"Where are we headed now?"

"To reach the Keywright's Gallery, we have to make it out of this ruin and across a wide field full of the golems I mentioned. With any luck, we'll be able to slip past them. But I'm not all that lucky. So, I'm sorry in advance."

"Alright, we'll head there next. What can we expect to encounter in the Gallery?"

"Well, it begins with a door - the first of many. The only way to access the Gallery is through a mysterious gateway. Once we pass through that initial door, we'll step into a huge vualt. This is the part that worries me most."

"Why does it worry you?"

"I believe Shyazzel, the Daedric creature that's causing all this mischief, may have nested itself in there. So be prepared to fight."

"Will dealing with Shyazzel pacify the golems?"

"I can't say anything with certainty, but ridding the world of an otherworldly abomination can't hurt, right? Its influence might linger for a time, but the golems should return to normal before too long. Hopefully."

"Let's go."

"Let's be on our way. A word of warning, though: some of the golems may wander the halls ahead. There shouldn't be many of them, but as my master used to say, prudence is victory's prophet! Sorry. He was very keen on weird proverbs."

Through the stone doorway, we enter another hall and climb a set of curving stairs up to the next floor. Norianwe gestures for me to stop, and points at a Golem Invoker at the end of the corridor, repeatedly slamming its stone fist against a locked door. 

"One of the stray golems," she says. "We might want to sneak past it."

I shake my head, pull out my staff, and slowly move across the corridor. I fully charge my inferno staff, and fire a volley of fireballs at the unaware golem, killing it instantly. The door it was trying to get into is locked, Norianwe tells me it leads to the Balfiera Armoury. Thankfully, I do have some experience picking locks from my teenage years. Norianwe hands me a turning tool and a lockpick. The five tumblers are easy to lock into place, and the door opens. 

The Balfiera Armoury is yet another decrepit stone room, with a decaying carpet leading down an aisle of weapon and armour stands, stopping just before a still lit forge. I equip myself with a full set of light armour and leave. There really is little of value in these halls.

We cross the bridge that overlooked the sparring platform, and head through one last corridor leading to Balfiera Island proper. Through the barred windows, I catch my first real glimpse of the land. The soil is overgrown, though clearly by design. A monument stands on a clearing, arches and pillars surrounding a giant statue of an ancient elf. Marching around it is a gargoyle, occasionally stopping to smash its fists into the ground, kicking up dirt. Shyazzel's influence extends to all matter of powerful constructs.

As we finally step out of the 

"Right. The entrance to the Keywright's Gallery should be east of here. Let's set out."
