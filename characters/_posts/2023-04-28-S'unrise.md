S'unrise, born to a simple life in Khenarthi's Roost, was killed by Mannimarco in 2E 582 in sacrifice to Molag Bal. After escaping her imprisonment in Coldharbour, she found herself disfigured, and unable to truly die.

She is also known throughout history as The Vestige, Eternal Champion, the Apprentice, the Agent, Nerevarine, Champion of Cyrodiil, Warrior, The Forgotten Hero, and the Last Dragonborn.

S'unrise is the main character of The Elder Scrolls, filling the role of the heroine in most of the games, and is commonly mistaken to be multiple people, hence her many titles.

In The Elder Scrolls Online, she appears as a Magicka Nightblade and uses Vampire themed skills and items.
