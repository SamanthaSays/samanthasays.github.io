<h1>Samantha Says</h1>
    
Hello there! My name is Samantha Says. I've been a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/samanthasays" title="Samantha Says' Twitch channel" target="_blank">Twitch streamer</a> since the 6th of May 2015, aiming to make you guys happy.

This website's HTML code is written by myself as a personal project with the help of <a href="https://pages.github.com" title="GitHub Pages" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, so I hope you like it. Across it, you can find:
<ul>
    <li>A catalogue of my Elder Scrolls characters.</li>
    <li>My modlists for various games.</li>
    <li>Any creative writing I may end up doing (probably about The Elder Scrolls).</li>
    <li>A gallery of pretty screenshots and Twitch VODs.</li>
    <li>Some niche guides that I've made for various people.</li>
    <li>Maybe even an Elder Scrolls idle game... if Bethesda won't make one, then I will.</li>
</ul>
Thanks for visiting! You can find and support me at the following links:
