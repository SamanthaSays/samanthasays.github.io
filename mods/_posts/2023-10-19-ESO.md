All add-ons are installed and managed through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.minion.gg">Minion 3</a>.

Remember to not just blindly copy somebody else's add-on selection. Make sure each add-on is one that you really want! Because of this, my installed Libraries are not listed.

Additionally, I use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/elderscrollsonline/mods/69">Sildurs Enhanced TESO</a> reshade. It's subtle, but really makes the image quality pop.

You can purchase The Elder Scrolls Online at <a target="_blank" href="https://greenmangaming.sjv.io/samanthasays-eso">Green Man Gaming</a> through my affiliate link.

Add-ons marked with a â™¥ heart are my top 10 favourites.
