I manage my mods and resource packs manually. It's fairly simple to do, so I never sought a reason to move to a mod manager for Minecraft.

Remember to not just blindly copy somebody else's mod list. Make sure each mod is one that you really want! Because of this, my installed dependencies are not listed.

Mods marked with a â™¥ heart are my top 6 favourites.
