<h1>Anonymous Feedback</h1>
Is the stream's audio a bit off? Am I smacking my lips against the mic? Is there a rogue pixel or misalignment somewhere? Are you having a problem with the website?

If you want to give some anonymous feedback, no matter how personal, I'd love to hear it!

To receive a response, you can instead <a href="https://contact.samanthasays.net" title="Contact form" target="_blank">contact me</a>.
